details:
This project is a KPI dashboard designed for small teams to track
weekly and monthly performance in a simple, structured way.

User authentication is handled via Firebase, ensuring that only
authorized users can access and submit KPI data. Once logged in,
users can submit updates, feedback, blockers, and support requests.

All KPI data is stored in Google Sheets, which acts as a lightweight
database. Google Apps Script is used as the backend layer to handle
data validation, reads, writes, and workflow logic.

The system is optimized for speed, low maintenance, and transparency,
making it suitable for internal team management and experimentation
without a heavy backend infrastructure.

Key experiments:
- Firebase authentication for secure user access
- Google Sheets used as a lightweight database
- Google Apps Script as a backend API layer
- KPI submission and review workflow
- Admin and user role separation
- Fast iteration without traditional backend servers
