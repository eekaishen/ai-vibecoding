details:
This project is a personal productivity web app that combines three daily workflows in one place: tasks (to-do), KPI tracking, and notes.

It’s designed to be minimal and fast: create tasks, categorize them (Work / Finance / Self), and track status such as Pending, Done, and Not completed. A calendar view makes it easy to see what’s planned across the month, while the Today panel keeps the daily focus clear.

The app also includes KPI and Notes tabs for quick logging, so planning, reporting, and reflection stay in one workflow instead of multiple tools.

Key features:
- Tasks with completion states (Pending / Done / Not completed)
- Category filters (Work / Finance / Self)
- Today overview + weekly/monthly views
- KPI logging section for quick updates
- Notes section for daily writing and quick capture
- Calendar view to visualize tasks across the month
- Lightweight UI built for speed and consistency
