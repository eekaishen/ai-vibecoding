details:
This project is a daily reflection and journaling web app designed to help users
capture what happened during their day in a simple, low-friction way.

Users input free-form reflections about their experiences, emotions, challenges,
and wins. Each entry is then analyzed using GPT to surface patterns, emotional
signals, recurring themes, and personal insights over time.

The goal is not just journaling, but structured self-awareness — transforming
unstructured daily thoughts into meaningful summaries and reflections that users
can learn from.

The app is designed to be fast, minimal, and distraction-free, encouraging
consistent daily usage without overwhelming the user with complex features.

Key experiments:
- Daily free-text reflection input
- GPT-powered sentiment and theme analysis
- Automated reflection summaries and insights
- Pattern recognition across multiple days
- Lightweight frontend-first web app architecture
- Exploring AI-assisted self-reflection and journaling workflows
