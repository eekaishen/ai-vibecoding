details:
This project is a daily reflection and journaling web app designed to help users
quickly capture what happened during their day in a simple, low-friction format.

Users write short, free-form reflections about their experiences, emotions,
challenges, and wins. Each entry is automatically emailed back to the user for
personal record-keeping and continuity.

Reflections are analyzed using Gemini AI to extract emotional signals, recurring
themes, behavioral patterns, and high-level insights. The system supports
multiple time perspectives, allowing users to review reflections over the
last 7 days, 1 month, or year-to-date.

The goal goes beyond journaling — it focuses on building structured
self-awareness by transforming unstructured daily thoughts into meaningful
summaries that users can reflect on and learn from over time.

The app is intentionally minimal, fast, and distraction-free, encouraging
consistent daily usage without overwhelming the user with complex workflows.

Key experiments:
- Daily free-text reflection input
- Email-to-self delivery for personal journaling records
- Gemini-powered sentiment and theme analysis
- Insight summaries across 7-day, monthly, and YTD ranges
- Pattern recognition from accumulated reflections
- Lightweight frontend-first web app architecture
- Exploring AI-assisted self-reflection and personal growth workflows
