details:
This project is designed to test and validate pre-registration
raffle mechanics for early-stage product launches.

The main objective is to cross-check Google Analytics (GA)
event tracking against affiliate software conversion data,
ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliable attribution.

Users can submit a raffle entry, receive a unique entry
number, and verify their registration, while structured
events are recorded for analysis and comparison.

Key features:
- Pre-registration raffle entry flow
- Entry number generation and validation
- Google Analytics event tracking
- Affiliate conversion accuracy comparison
- Lightweight static setup for fast experimentation
